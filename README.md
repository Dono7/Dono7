### Hi there ! 👋

My name is Donovan, I am a web and software developer. I also have a strong interest for UI/UX Design.

I enjoy working with new technologies, programming languages, and frameworks. I have a special attachment to **Javascript** and **VueJS**. I also work with **Figma** or **Photoshop** for designing or prototyping my websites and apps. I am currently learning **Typescript** and **Three.JS** (3D rendering with Javascript).
