### Hi there ! 👋

My name is Donovan, I am a web and software developer. I also have a strong interest for UI/UX Design.

I enjoy working with new technologies, programming languages, and frameworks. I have a special attachment to **Javascript** and **VueJS**. I also work with **Figma** or **Photoshop** for designing or prototyping my websites and apps.

# Current Projects 

## Minesweeperjs 💣 💥

I started developing [minesweeperjs](https://github.com/Dono7/MinesweeperJS) in 2020, a javascript package that contains to logic of the Minesweeper game. The package is available on NPM or usable in the browser via a CDN.

## Unlighter 💡 🖥️

By far my biggest project, [Unlighter](https://unlighter.app/) is a free an open-source software that helps you reduce your screens brightness. It can work with every type of screens (laptop screen, or plugged monitors), up to 4 screens at the same time.

You can learn more about it on the dedicated [Github Unlighter Repo](https://github.com/Dono7/Unlighter).

You can also visit the website to **download the app** or try an **online demo** :
